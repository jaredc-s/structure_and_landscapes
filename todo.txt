Tasks For Next Week:
===================================================================================
J^3:
figure out mutation problem

Joe:
look up computing resources at UW (thousands of hours not millions)
determine optimal parameters for rna_organism...
	-able to imporve
	-able to get close to the optimum
	-alot of variance in the outcome
	-some runs do well and some make it 
	-for both structured and unstructured populations 
	-#deems and migration rate...heat map
	-

Josh:
look up commercial cloud options 
write up a peristence module ...


Jared: 
lazy nk_table 

====================================================================================
look up computing resources!!!
a job that should take a second

Stats in Python:
*t-test
*std error
*anovas 
*correlation 

Visualizations:
*line graphs
*bar charts
*heat maps ---> mutatation rate vs rugedness temp = 
max fitness at end of a pop
showing three dimensions 

*3d figures --> contour map embed legends etc... 
*embed images into figures --> compact figures
*output visualizations in a variety of formats png, pdf, bmp

Data Output:
*pickles ! and shelve
*other ways of storing python objects ...
*csv...

What to save:
*all params
*version program - evaluation
*data itself - organisms that exist in a population over time...
*time stamp - uniqueness in results object key!!!
*replicate number... - refer to a paticular run...

What to add:
*mean
*std error population fitness @ every generation (some interval)
*max fitness over same interval 

*generating data for representation of data 
*easy ways to specify parameters (mutation rates, starting org etc!)
*using data well have results.db
